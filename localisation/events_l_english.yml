 fra_bof.1.d:0 "One can not say; that France was a land of peace for any major amount of time. It always had to face revolutions; rioting; restorations; invasions and so much more. And now, France faces yet another crisis. The crisis of a crown. It all started on December second, 1961.  Our brave, General de Gaulle, as he has always been more of a monarchist than greatest defender of the Republic; proclaimed the restoration of the monarchy. However, instead of the Orleans most expected, Colonel Louis Napoleon came to be the one chosen. Now of course, at first, there were many celebrations by conservative clubs and Bonapartists who saw this as a fulfillment of a destiny. . .but soon enough, the dark side of this restoration came. The CNIP and the Parti Socialist, liberals and social democrats respectively, came to resist this development and proclaimed the "Ligue Républicaine" to defy the General and the Emperor. This however, neither undid the restoration, nor did it bring order. In truth, it set off a catalyst of Communist rioting, army complaints and much more. And now; France stands at a major crossroads. On one hand, if De Gaulle wins, France's constitutional monarchy will be secured under the safe, benevolent but tight glove of De Gaulle. On the other, if the Crown and De Gaulle lose. . .who knows what could come out of the Republic, commune and others. The gamble at play here, is enormous and it can not be understated, how important it is that this process, of either change or restoration, goes without bloodshed. France, in her current situation, can not allow blood, or worse, a civil war. Thus, it only remains to be seen, how far will France go, to preserve herself."
